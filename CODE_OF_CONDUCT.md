## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders of the AsteriskEngine project pledge to make participation in our game engine and its community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for game engine development include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language in code, documentation, and discussions
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences, especially regarding game development tools, workflows, and design decisions
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism about code, features, or documentation
- Offering help and guidance to new contributors and users

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Public or private harassment, including persistent unwanted contact or attention
- Publishing others’ private information, such as real names or contact details, without explicit permission

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.
